# KyaraFlip Fundamental License (KFL v0.9, Preview)

> This license defines a **non-exclusive permission** granted for **works** and associated **Live Cards** published on KyaraFlip to ensure smooth in-service usage.  
> The **[Terms of Service](https://kyaraflip.com/en/legal/terms)** take precedence over this document. Not legal advice.  
> Canonical source (latest + version history): https://github.com/NexA-LLC/kyaraflip-basic-license  
> This English text is provided for convenience only. The Japanese text is authoritative; in case of conflict, the Japanese text prevails.  
> Note: The repository's Apache-2.0 license does not apply to this license text.

## Terminology
- **Work**: A published container entry on KyaraFlip, including its metadata and public page.
- **Live Card (Artifact)**: An asset attached to a Work (character profile, scenario, illustration, music, etc.).
- **Flip**: The umbrella term for interactive sessions or replays delivered by KyaraFlip. It covers gameplay or viewing experiences using the relevant Works and Live Cards.
- **Replica Live Card**: An official duplicate of a Live Card distributed by KyaraFlip or the original creator. Replicas are intended for in-service use by users (e.g., inside Flips or compatible games).

For the purposes of this license, “NexA” refers to **NexA LLC**, the operator of KyaraFlip.

## 1. Rights granted (creator → NexA/KyaraFlip)
By publishing content, the rights holder grants NexA a **worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, and revocable** license to:
- **Host, cache, transcode, and reproduce** the work within the Service.  
- Apply **minor adaptations** required for staging/UI (e.g., resizing, trimming, subtitles/localisation, BGM sync, motion cues).  
- **Publicly transmit** and display the work in feeds, rankings, or recommendations.  
- Retain limited copies for **backup, audit, and logging**.

> Note: This does **not** include commercial redistribution outside the Service unless separately agreed.

## 2. Rights granted (creator → other users)
- Other users may **view, Flip, and utilise** the work/live card inside compatible games/worlds on the Service.  
- Official **Replica Live Cards** distributed by KyaraFlip or the creator may be used within the same scope (e.g., in Flips or compatible games). Redistributing the replica itself or using it outside the Service is not permitted.
- **Off-service reuse or redistribution is prohibited** unless the creator separately authorises it (e.g., via Creative Commons).
- Such third-party usage is considered **part of the platform’s core functionality**; any resulting monetisation is handled through the Creator Support Guidelines (with potential future UI flags for non-commercial works).

## 3. Attribution
- The work page displays the **rights holder name** as provided by the uploader. Presentation follows the Service’s design guidelines.

## 4. Revocation & residual copies
- Rights holders may request **unpublication or deletion**. New in-service use stops, but  
  technical remnants (cache, logs, previously distributed broadcasts) may persist for a limited period to maintain integrity.

## 5. Claims & disputes
- On receiving a claim, the work may be **temporarily hidden or paused** while we review it, after which we may update **display, payouts, or credits** or remove the work.  
- Related refunds/chargebacks are handled via **accounting offsets** (see the Creator Support Guidelines).

## 6. Relationship to revenue
- This license does **not guarantee monetisation or payouts**. Any revenue features are governed by the Creator Support Guidelines.

## 7. Priority
- In the event of a conflict between this license and the Terms of Service, the **Terms of Service prevail**.
