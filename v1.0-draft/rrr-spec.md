# Replica Redistribution Rights (RRR) — Draft Spec

> **DRAFT / NOT EFFECTIVE**

This document defines the intended semantics and requirements for Replica Redistribution Rights (RRR).

## Goals
- Allow redistribution of official replicas under explicit conditions
- Preserve attribution and provenance metadata
- Support automated revenue sharing (schema-referenced)

## Non-goals (for now)
- Defining on-chain enforcement
- Defining a universal DRM mechanism

## Requirements (draft)
- Metadata must be preserved (license version, IDs, attribution, hashes, signatures)
- Prohibited: impersonation, metadata tampering, signature removal, access control bypass
- Revocation/suspension flow must be defined for abuse
